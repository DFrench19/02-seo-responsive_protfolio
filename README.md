# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

In this homework I had to make a responsie Portfolio with a about me, portfolio, and a contact me page. 
Im still learning how to do the basics of html and css, so its not the the best looking, but it get the idea across.
Hopefully I will be able to make better looking webpages in the future.
